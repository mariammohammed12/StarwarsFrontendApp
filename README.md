# Starwars React and Typescript Frontend App

A React frontend application built using React,TypeScript and npm packages such as Material UI for CSS. This app is related to Starwars topics such as films, starships and vehicles, which a user can search for and view the results of the specific topic they are looking for. The search results can be sorted by order by selecting title for films or name for starships and vehicles once the Sort By dropdown is clicked.

```


## Running the app

In the project's root directory you can run `npm start` to run the web application on  [http://localhost:3000]


## Future work 

There are many ways to implement this app, The route I would go through is creating blog posts of information and adding more topics such as people, planets and many more to make this application more interesting. 
Another idea is to make it interactive by creating a forum for the fanbase to communicate with each other to talk about the films, adaptations,latest updates or be apart of trivia games and interactive quizzes.
